## Heart Attack Risk Prediction with Machine Learning

## Description

This project analyzes heart attack risk factors using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, feature analysis, and model training to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on medical attributes. Various statistical and visualization methods are used to explore the dataset before applying machine learning models.

## Implementation Details

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, standardization, and feature selection.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Correlation analysis, box plots, scatter plots, and categorical feature analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy score and ROC curve analysis.

## Results

The model was trained and evaluated to assess its performance in predicting heart attack risk. Various features were analyzed for their impact on the prediction accuracy. The best-performing model was fine-tuned using GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters, leading to improved predictive performance.
