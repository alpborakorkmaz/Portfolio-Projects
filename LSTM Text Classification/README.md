## Description
This project implements a text classification model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The dataset used is the 20 Newsgroups dataset, which is preprocessed and tokenized before being fed into the model. The model is trained to classify text into different categories using deep learning techniques.

## Result
- The dataset is preprocessed using tokenization and padding.
- A sequential LSTM model is built with embedding layers, LSTM layers, dropout, and dense layers.
- The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
