# Diabetes Decision Tree Modeling

The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis using a Decision Tree algorithm. This model is designed to assist healthcare professionals in identifying patients at risk of diabetes based on various health indicators.

This notebook demonstrates the entire process, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, and provides insights into how decision trees can be effectively used for medical predictions.
