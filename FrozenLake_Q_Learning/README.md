# FrozenLake Q-Learning

## Project Description

This project implements a machine learning model using the Q-Learning algorithm to solve the FrozenLake environment from OpenAI Gym. The objective is to train an agent to navigate a frozen lake safely while avoiding holes and reaching the goal. The dataset consists of the agent's interactions with the environment, including states, actions, and rewards. Data preprocessing involves handling state representations and optimizing the learning process.

## Results

Different configurations of the Q-Learning algorithm were tested, including variations in learning rate, discount factor, and exploration strategies. The model was evaluated based on the success rate of reaching the goal. Performance metrics such as cumulative rewards and convergence rate were analyzed. Feature engineering techniques, such as modifying state representations and optimizing hyperparameters, were employed to enhance learning efficiency. The results demonstrated that exploration strategies and reward structuring significantly influenced the agent's success in navigating the frozen lake.
