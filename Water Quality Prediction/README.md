## Water Quality Prediction

## Project Description

This project aims to predict water quality using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features related to water quality, such as pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and other chemical properties. The goal is to classify whether the water is safe for consumption based on these parameters.

Water quality assessment is crucial for ensuring public health and environmental safety. By leveraging data-driven approaches, this project helps identify patterns in water composition and detect potential contamination. The insights gained from this analysis can aid in better decision-making for water treatment facilities, regulatory bodies, and environmental researchers.

The dataset used in this study includes multiple water quality indicators collected from various sources. These indicators provide valuable information regarding water safety levels and help in the early detection of hazardous conditions. Proper data preprocessing and feature engineering were performed to enhance the model's predictive accuracy.
## Results

The analysis showed that specific water quality parameters significantly impact classification accuracy. Factors such as pH levels, dissolved oxygen content, and turbidity play a crucial role in determining water safety. The results indicate that abnormal values in these parameters can be strong indicators of poor water quality.

To evaluate the performance of different machine learning models, various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were utilized. The models were trained and tested on the dataset to ensure robust predictions. The findings can help in better water quality monitoring, enabling authorities to take preventive actions in case of contamination.

Additionally, the study demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively applied to environmental science problems. The developed models can be further refined and integrated into real-time monitoring systems to ensure continuous assessment of water quality. This project highlights the potential of data-driven approaches in addressing critical public health concerns.
