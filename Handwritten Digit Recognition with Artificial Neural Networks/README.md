## Handwritten Digit Recognition with Artificial Neural Networks

## Description

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal is to train a neural network to classify these digits accurately. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Implementation Details

- **Dataset:** MNIST handwritten digit dataset
- **Preprocessing:** Image normalization and one-hot encoding of labels
- **Model Architecture:** Sequential ANN with fully connected layers
- **Optimization:** Early stopping and model checkpointing
- **Libraries Used:** Keras, TensorFlow, Matplotlib

## Results

The trained model was evaluated on the test set, achieving high accuracy in classifying handwritten digits. Performance metrics such as accuracy and loss were analyzed during training. The final model demonstrated robust performance in recognizing digits, making it suitable for real-world digit classification tasks.
