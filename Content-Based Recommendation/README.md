# Content-Based Recommendation System

This project implements a **Content-Based Recommendation System** using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to recommend items based on user preferences. The model analyzes item features and matches them to user preferences to generate relevant recommendations.

## Project Overview
This content-based recommendation system suggests items based on their similarity to items a user has interacted with. By comparing the features of different items (like keywords, descriptions, or other metadata), it provides personalized recommendations.
