RFM Analysis on Online Retail Dataset
This repository contains an RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis performed on an online retail dataset. 
Project Overview
In this project, I analyze the "Online Retail II" dataset using the RFM methodology. The main goal is to categorize customers based on:

Recency: How recently did the customer make a purchase?
Frequency: How often does the customer purchase?
Monetary: How much money did the customer spend?

The results of the analysis are used to identify customer segments such as high-value customers, potential churners, and others.
