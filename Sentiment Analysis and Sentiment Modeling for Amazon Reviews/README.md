# Sentiment Analysis and Sentiment Modeling for Amazon Reviews

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Sentiment Analysis** and building **Sentiment Models** using Amazon review data. The goal is to analyze customer sentiments expressed in reviews and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis can be a powerful tool for understanding customer feedback, improving services, and making data-driven decisions.

## Purpose
The main objectives of this project are:
- To explore and preprocess the Amazon review dataset.
- To apply various sentiment analysis techniques, including machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) methods.
- To build and evaluate sentiment models for predicting customer sentiment.
- To visualize insights derived from the sentiment data.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Text cleaning, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization.
- **Feature Engineering:** TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Word embeddings were used to convert text into numeric features for the model.
- **Model Building:** Several machine learning models were built and compared.
- **Model Evaluation:** Detailed evaluation of models using various metrics.
- **Visualizations:** Insights such as word clouds and sentiment distributions are visualized.
