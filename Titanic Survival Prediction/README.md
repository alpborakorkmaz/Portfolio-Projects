# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Description

In this project, a machine learning model is developed to predict the survival status of passengers in the Titanic disaster. The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and embarkation point. The data is preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature selection to improve model performance.

## Results

Different machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, were applied to predict the survival of passengers. The models were trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Feature engineering techniques, such as creating new features from existing ones and optimizing hyperparameters, were used to enhance model performance. The results showed that factors like ticket class, gender, and fare had a significant impact on survival probability.
